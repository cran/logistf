\usage{
logistftest(
  object,
  test,
  values,
  firth = TRUE,
  beta0,
  weights,
  control,
  modcontrol,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted \code{logistf} object}

\item{test}{righthand formula of parameters to test (e.g. ~ B + D - 1). As default
all parameter apart from the intercept are tested. If the formula includes -1, the
intercept is omitted from testing. As alternative to the formula one can give
the indexes of the ordered effects to test (a vector of integers). To test only the
intercept specify test = ~ - . or test = 1.}

\item{values}{Null hypothesis values, default values are 0. For testing the specific hypothesis
B1=1, B4=2, B5=0 we specify test= ~B1+B4+B5-1 and values=c(1, 2,0).}

\item{firth}{Use of Firth's (1993) penalized maximum likelihood (firth=TRUE, default) or
the standard maximum likelihood method (firth=FALSE) for the logistic regression.
Note that by specifying pl=TRUE and firth=FALSE (and probably lower number of iterations)
one obtains profile likelihood confidence intervals for maximum likelihood logistic
regression parameters.}

\item{beta0}{Specifies the initial values of the coefficients for the fitting algorithm}

\item{weights}{Case weights}

\item{control}{Controls parameters for iterative fitting}

\item{modcontrol}{Controls additional parameter for fitting. Default is \code{modcontrol} of \code{object}.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to logistf.fit}
}
\value{
The object returned is of the class logistf and has the following attributes:
\item{testcov}{A vector of the fixed values of each covariate; NA stands for a parameter which is not tested.}
\item{loglik}{A vector of the (penalized) log-likelihood of the full and the restricted models. If
the argument beta0 not missing, the full model isn't evaluated}
\item{df}{The number of degrees of freedom in the model}
\item{prob}{The p-value of the test}
\item{call}{The call object}
\item{method}{Depending on the fitting method 'Penalized ML' or 'Standard ML'}
\item{beta}{The coefficients of the restricted solution}
}
\description{
This function performs a penalized likelihood ratio test on some (or all) selected factors.
The resulting object is of the class logistftest and includes the information printed by the
proper print method.

\details{
This function performs a penalized likelihood ratio test on some (or all) selected factors. The resulting object is of the class logistftest and includes the information printed by the proper print
method. Further documentation can be found in Heinze & Ploner (2004).
In most cases, the functionality of the logistftest function is replaced by anova.logistf, which
is a more standard way to perform likelihood ratio tests. However, as shown in the example below, logistftest provides some specials such as testing against non-zero values. (By the way,
anova.logistf calls logistftest.

\examples{
data(sex2) 
fit<-logistf(case ~ age+oc+vic+vicl+vis+dia, data=sex2)
logistftest(fit, test = ~ vic + vicl - 1, values = c(2, 0))
