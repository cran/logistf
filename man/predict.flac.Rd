\title{Predict Method for flac Fits}
\usage{
\method{predict}{flac}(object, newdata, type = c("link", "response"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted object of class \code{flac}.}

\item{newdata}{Optionally, a data frame in which to look for variables with which to predict. If omitted, the fitted linear predictors are used.}

\item{type}{The type of prediction required. The default is on the scale of the linear predictors. The alternative \code{response} gives the predicted probabilities.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A vector or matrix of predictions.
}
\description{
Obtains predictions from a fitted \code{flac} object.
}
\details{
If \code{newdata} is omitted the predictions are based on the data used for the fit.
