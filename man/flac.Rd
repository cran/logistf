\description{
\code{flac} implements Firth's bias-reduced penalized-likelihood logistic regression with added covariate.
}
\details{
Flac is a simple modification of Firth's logistic regression which provides average predicted
probabilities equal to the observed proportion of events, while preserving the ability to deal
with seperation.

The modified score equation to estimate coefficients for Firth's logistic regression can be 
interpreted as score equations for ML estimates for an augmented data set. This data set can be 
created by complementing each original observation i with two pseudo-observations weighted by 
\eqn{h_i/2} with unchanged covariate values and with response values set to \eqn{y=0} and \eqn{y=1}
respectively. The basic idea of Flac is to discriminate between original and pseudo-observations
in the alternative formulation of Firth's estimation as an iterative data augmentation procedure.
The following generic methods are available for flac's output object: \code{print, summary, coef, confint, anova, extractAIC, add1, drop1, 
profile, terms, nobs, predict}. Furthermore, forward and backward functions perform convenient variable selection. Note 
that anova, extractAIC, add1, drop1, forward and backward are based on penalized likelihood 
ratios.
