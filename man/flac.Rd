\arguments{
\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the method or \code{\link{logistf}}-call.}

\item{formula}{A formula object, with the response on the left of the operator,
and the model terms on the right. The response must be a vector with 0 and 1 or \code{FALSE} and
\code{TRUE} for the outcome, where the higher value (1 or \code{TRUE}) is modeled.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables in the model.}

\item{model}{If TRUE the corresponding components of the fit are returned.}

\item{control}{Controls iteration parameter. Taken from \code{logistf}-object when specified. Otherwise default is \code{control= logistf.control()}.}

\item{modcontrol}{Controls additional parameter for fitting. Taken from \code{logistf}-object when specified. Otherwise default is \code{logistf.mod.control()}.}

\item{weights}{specifies case weights. Each line of the input data set is multiplied
by the corresponding element of weights}

\item{offset}{a priori known component to be included in the linear predictor}

\item{na.action}{a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain NAs}

\item{lfobject}{A fitted \code{\link{logistf}} object.}

\value{
A \code{flac} object with components:
\item{coefficients}{The coefficients of the parameter in the fitted model.}

\item{df}{The number of degrees of freedom in the model.}
\item{method}{depending on the fitting method 'Penalized ML' or \verb{Standard ML'.\} \\item\{method.ci\}\{the method in calculating the confidence intervals, i.e. }profile likelihood' or `Wald', depending on the argument pl and plconf.}

\description{
\code{flac} implements Firth's bias-reduced penalized-likelihood logistic regression with added covariate.
}
\details{
FLAC is a simple modification of Firth's logistic regression which provides average predicted
probabilities equal to the observed proportion of events, while preserving the ability to deal
with separation. It has been described by Puhr et al (2017).

The modified score equations to estimate coefficients for Firth's logistic regression can be
interpreted as score equations for ML estimates for an augmented data set. This data set can be
created by complementing each original observation i with two pseudo-observations weighted by
\eqn{h_i/2} with unchanged covariate values and with response values set to \eqn{y=0} and \eqn{y=1}
respectively. The basic idea of FLAC is to discriminate between original and pseudo-observations
in the alternative formulation of Firth's estimation as an iterative data augmentation procedure.
The following generic methods are available for ' \code{flac}'s output object: \code{print, summary, coef, confint, anova, extractAIC, add1, drop1, 
profile, terms, nobs, predict}. Furthermore, forward and backward functions perform convenient variable selection. Note
that anova, extractAIC, add1, drop1, forward and backward are based on penalized likelihood
ratio tests.
