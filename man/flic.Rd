\description{
\code{flic} implements Firth's bias-Reduced penalized-likelihood logistic regression with intercept correction.
}
\details{
Flic is a simple modification of Firth's logistic regression which provides average predicted
probabilities equal to the observed proportion of events, while preserving the ability to deal
with separation.

In general the average predicted probability in FL regression is not equal to the observed 
proportion of events. Because the determinant of the Fisher-Information matrix is maximized 
for \eqn{\pi_i = \frac{1}{2}} it is concluded that Firth's penalization tends to push the 
predicted probabilities towards one-half compared with ML-estimation.
Flic fits a logistic regression model applying Firth's correction to the likelihood with a 
correction of the intercept, such that the predicted probabilities become unbiased while
keeping all other coefficients constant.
The following generic methods are available for flic's output object: \code{print, summary, coef, confint, anova, extractAIC, add1, drop1, 
profile, terms, nobs, predict}. Furthermore, forward and backward functions perform convenient variable selection. Note 
that anova, extractAIC, add1, drop1, forward and backward are based on penalized likelihood 
ratios.
