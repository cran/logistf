Description: Fit a logistic regression model using Firth's bias reduction method, equivalent to penalization of the log-likelihood by the Jeffreys 
	prior. Confidence intervals for regression coefficients can be computed by penalized profile likelihood. Firth's method was proposed as ideal
	solution to the problem of separation in logistic regression. If needed, the bias reduction can be turned off such that ordinary
	maximum likelihood logistic regression is obtained.
