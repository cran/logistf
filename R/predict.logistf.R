#' Predict Method for logistf Fits
#'
#' Obtains predictions from a fitted \code{logistf} object. 
#' 
#' If \code{newdata} is omitted the predictions are based on the data used for the fit. 
#' 
#' 
#' @param object A fitted object of class \code{logistf}.
#'
#' @param newdata Optionally, a data frame in which to look for variables with which to predict. 
#' If omitted, the fitted linear predictors are used.  
#' @param type The type of prediction required. The default is on the scale of the linear predictors. 
#' The alternative \code{response} gives the predicted probabilities. 
#' @param flic If \code{TRUE}(default = \code{FALSE}), predictions are computed with intercept correction.
#' @param ... further arguments passed to or from other methods.
#'
#' @return A vector or matrix of predictions.
